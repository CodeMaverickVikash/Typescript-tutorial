# TypeScript learner project
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features to help developers write more maintainable and scalable code. Here are some of the key features of TypeScript. Below are the key features of TypeScript:
- **Static Typing**:
    - TypeScript introduces static typing, allowing developers to specify the types of variables, function parameters, and return values.
    - Helps catch type-related errors during development rather than at runtime.
- **Interfaces**:
    - Allows the definition of custom data structures using interfaces.
    - Helps in enforcing a contract between different parts of the code.
- **Enums**:
    - Enables the creation of named constant values.
    - Enhances code readability and maintainability.
- **Generics**:
    - Allows the creation of reusable components with the ability to work with any data type.
    - Enhances code flexibility and type safety.
- **Type Inference or Implicit type assignment**:
    - TypeScript has a powerful type inference system that can automatically deduce the types of variables and expressions.
- **Union and Intersection Types**:
    - A union type allows a variable to have multiple types. It is expressed using the `| (pipe)` symbol.
    - An intersection type combines multiple types into a single type. It is expressed using the `& (ampersand`) symbol.
- **Type Assertion**:
    - Allows developers to tell the compiler to treat a value as a specific type.
- **Tuples**:
    - A tuple is a data structure that allows you to define an ordered collection of elements, where each element can have a different data type. Tuples are similar to arrays, but they have a fixed length, and the types of their elements are known at compile time.
- **String Literal Types**:
    - String Literal Types in TypeScript allow you to define a specific set of string values that a variable, parameter, or property can have. This feature enhances type safety and code clarity by restricting the possible values to a predefined set
- **Modules**:
    - Supports the organization of code into reusable and maintainable modules.
    - The file created in typescript has global access, which means that variables declared in one file are easily accessed in another file.
    - This global nature can cause code conflicts and can cause issues with execution at run-time
    - We  have export and import module functionality which can be used to avoid global variable and function conflicts.
    - This feature is available in the javascript es6 release and also supported in typescript.
- **Declaration Files**:
    - Allows the use of external libraries written in JavaScript by providing type declarations in .d.ts files.
- **Decorators**:
    - Provides a way to add metadata and modify the behavior of classes and class members.
    - It is used to extend the functionality of classes and methods.
    - There is three types of Decorators: class, method, and property Decorators.
- **Namespace**:
    - Enables developers to group related code into a named namespace, preventing naming collisions.
    - Namespaces provide a way to organize and encapsulate code. Namespaces are often used to prevent naming conflicts in larger codebases.
